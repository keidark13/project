## Ideas

- 2026-04-26 — Outcome-based project card copy — current cards list features ("7 workflows automated"), should pivot to outcomes ("18% reactivation, 30-day lost-lead recovery"). Same word count, 10x weight. Apply once 2-3 projects have measured results.
- 2026-04-26 — Stat-backing pass — "3+ Years / 20+ Clients / 40% Avg ROAS" need scope ("40% avg ROAS lift across 14 Google Ads accounts"). Adds proof, kills "AI-generated" feel.
- 2026-04-26 — 1280px breakpoint test — hero photo + 6 floating checklist cards may collide on 1280-wide laptops (fine on 1440). Verify responsive.

- 2026-04-17 — Fix stale pre-emerald palette refs in `rules/rules.md` — graphify found `#0F0F23`/`#7C3AED` still referenced. Low priority, cosmetic only.
- 2026-04-17 — Expand GHL Sniffer API Reference — currently 64 endpoints, real GHL API v2 has 468. Add remaining categories as needed.
- 2026-04-17 — Re-run graphify with `.graphifyignore` active — will skip bundled AdsRadar JS, cleaner graph with ~165 meaningful nodes instead of 790.
- 2026-04-17 — Reverse engineer engine.shopiator.com — Shopiator Audit Engine (Next.js/Vercel/Geist UI, Google Ads audit dashboard for managed accounts). Login-gated, need auth to see dashboard. Same concept as AdsRadar but multi-account. Could clone as upgraded AdsRadar v2.

- 2026-03-22 — Blog / content section — A writing section where Keyvin publishes automation tutorials or case studies. Would position him as a thought leader and drive organic SEO traffic. Not now because the core site needs to ship first.
- 2026-03-22 — Testimonials section — A dedicated section for client quotes/logos. Worthwhile once there are 3+ strong testimonials to show. Placeholder card exists in design language.
- ~~2026-03-22 — Dark/light mode toggle~~ — DONE (implemented 2026-04-07)
- 2026-03-22 — Animated project cards with live metrics — Show real stats (e.g., "↑ 43% conversion rate") that update from a backend. High impact but requires API/CMS infrastructure. Park until after launch.
- 2026-03-22 — GHL automation showcase page — A dedicated sub-page or modal showing actual GHL workflow screenshots or a short walkthrough video. Strong social proof for automation clients.

## Experiments to Try
- A/B test hero CTA copy: "Book a Free Audit" vs "Let's Talk Strategy" vs "See What I've Built"
- Test particle density / speed on the BeamsBackground canvas for different device classes

## Tools to Explore
- Flowise — AI agent builder (self-hosted, visual drag-and-drop). Good for kei site chatbot / GHL lead qualification workflows. Install pending as of 2026-04-08.
- repomix — installed, use `npx repomix` per project to pack codebase for Claude context
- Google Apps Script automations — auto-archive, invoice tracker, weekly report auto-send, Drive organizer, auto-reply. Script already deployed at script.google.com. See memory: project_google_apps_script.md
- nanobanana MCP image generation — fixed 2026-04-17, test quality after CC restart. Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. Images save to `C:\Users\User\nanobanana-images\`. Compare output quality vs Playwright HTML-to-PNG fallback.

## Articles / Resources to Read
- ~~Formspree vs Web3Forms vs Resend~~ — RESOLVED: using Netlify Forms (already on Netlify, zero config)

## Career-Ops Follow-Ups (raised 2026-04-16)
- Loom walkthrough script (60-90 sec) for GHL CV applications — record once, attach to all GHL apps
- Build sample CPD module structure as free pre-deliverable for Pipeline Pro applicant pitch
- 1-page tight CV variants (some platforms cap pages)
- Cover letter DOCX templates auto-generated from each CV
- Apply winning-cv-generator to remaining 4 active job apps (Ruach, GHL Specialist, PlanetArt, Lumaprints) — refresh existing CVs

## Refactors to Consider Later
- Extract the canvas BeamsBackground into its own `js/beams.js` module for clarity
- Move inline CSS variables from `:root` into a dedicated `css/tokens.css` file for better organization
- AdsRadar: code-split xlsx lib to trim 537KB bundle via `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks`
- AdsRadar: dark-theme the downloaded HTML dashboard report to match app (currently light-themed for client delivery)
- AdsRadar: add SVG favicon + PWA manifest for install-to-homescreen
- AdsRadar: separate GitHub repo for source (currently only built output is in kei repo)
